# Review decision

Project-scoped candidate for agent-queue train configuration. Adapted from the
historical integration graph with a new identity and current command contracts.
The parent route handles `already_completed` as idempotent success and `failed`
as failure. Commands receive durable subject identities; CI trust, Git refs,
repair budgets, and promotion authority stay server-owned. Import and activation
require operator review. The bundle has no automatic activation.

## Subject table handoff

The disabled bundle includes a source-owned integration decision table.
Existing event rules remain available for feature-off rollback. Each subject
retains its exact artifact pin. Gate choices and replay deadlines are explicit;
root publication needs the observed publisher fence, distinct from repair
writer authority. Agent Queue retains authorized continuation; the generic
template retains a no-default exhaustion gate. Import/activation and production
cutover evidence remain operator-owned.

## Candidate construction contract refresh (2026-10-04)

Rebuilt with `scripts/rebuild-reviewed-playbook-artifacts.py` after the
`integration_build_candidate` execution fingerprint changed. The semantic diff
retains every rule, step, transition, capability, source hash and integration
decision table. Only that command's compiled fingerprint and compile timestamp
changed; the artifact digest and aggregate contract fingerprint follow them.
No compiler questions remain. Installed activation and frozen operation pins
are still owned by the operator and daemon.

## Dashboard check-set alignment (2026-10-04)

The reviewed subject table now names the sixteen-check workflow set, including
`Dashboard (typecheck/build)`, and observes its derived version
`ci-4f7c710bba01`. This keeps the frozen table and train policy consistent.
Installed activations and existing operation pins retain their current versions.
