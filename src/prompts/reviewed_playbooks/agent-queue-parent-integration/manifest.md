# Review decision

Project-scoped candidate for agent-queue train configuration. Adapted from the
historical integration graph with a new identity and current command contracts.
The parent route handles `already_completed` as idempotent success and `failed`
as failure. Commands receive durable subject identities; CI trust, Git refs,
repair budgets, and promotion authority stay server-owned. Import and activation
require operator review. The bundle has no automatic activation.

CI repair `clear-quest-21` refreshed the record and timeout command fingerprints
for the new `supervisor_recovery` action. Reviewed rules, steps, transitions,
capability grants and source text are unchanged; no-progress incidents remain
owned by the command service.

Phase 2 adds an inactive parent decision table over the existing primitives.
It selects receipt-driven collection and intent read-back, the existing failed
verification recovery, shared verifier filing/lease and exact CI verification.
Failed children, conflicts, old repair dossiers and expired writer budgets use
explicit no-default gates. Import remains write-if-absent and no activation or
engine transfer is authorized by this bundle. Operator rollout review binds the
new digest before cutover.
