Integration CI repair refreshes the reconciliation contract and explicitly maps
`continued` and `superseded` to completion, and `waiting` and `target_moved` to
failure, matching the server's current outcome classifications. This preserves
the exact remote reconciliation requirement and grants no additional capability.
The new digest still requires operator review before activation.

# Review decision

System-scoped shared parent route for any project's train policy. The graph is
the reviewed `agent-queue-parent-integration` graph unchanged: the same rules,
steps, transitions and command contracts, compiled at system scope, with each
source reference moved to the same rule heading of the shared source. A system
activation serves only projects whose frozen policy route names this playbook
(`INTEGRATION_LIFECYCLE_PLAYBOOK_IDS`, `src/playbooks/services.py`), never every
project's lifecycle events. Commands receive durable subject identities; CI
trust, Git refs, repair budgets, and promotion authority stay server-owned.
Import and activation require operator review. The bundle has no automatic
activation.

CI repair `clear-quest-21` refreshed the record and timeout command fingerprints
for the new `supervisor_recovery` action. Reviewed rules, steps, transitions,
capability grants and source text are unchanged; no-progress incidents remain
owned by the command service.

Phase 2 adds an inactive parent decision table over the existing primitives.
It selects receipt-driven collection and intent read-back, the existing failed
verification recovery, shared verifier filing/lease and exact CI verification.
Failed children, conflicts, old repair dossiers and expired writer budgets use
explicit no-default gates. Import remains write-if-absent and no activation or
engine transfer is authorized by this bundle. Operator rollout review binds the
new digest before cutover.
